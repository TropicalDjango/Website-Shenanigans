		These are all of my major <em> assignments</em> for university grouped by the class. If you wish to only <strong>read</strong> the <strong>README file</strong> of an assignment, use the directory at the top of the page. If you want to <strong>download</strong> the <strong>script</strong> and <strong>README</strong> in a <strong>ZIP file</strong> click the links below to access the assignment of your choosing. All minor assignments can be found on the Github.

			<li class = 'projects'><a href = 'Projects/huffman_compressor.zip', class = 'projects'>
			Huffman compression and decompression (Python)</a></li>
			
			<p>
			you will be writing programs that compress and decompress files using Huffmancodes.  
			The compressor will be a command-line utility that encodes any file into a compressed version with a .huf extension.  
			The decompressor will be a web server that will let you directly browse com-pressed files, decoding them on-the-fly 
			as they are being sent to your web browser.
			</p>
			
			<li class = 'projects'><a href = 'Projects/encrypted_communication.zip', class = 'projects'>
			Encrypted Arduino Communication (C++)</a></li>
			
			<p>
			This project uses the standard RSA encryption algorithm to allow for encryted
			communication between two different arduinos. The program will generate a set
			of public and private keys and modolos for use in RSA encryption and will allow 
			for a basic chat program between the two users.

		<h3>CMPUT 275</h3>
		<ul class = 'select'>
			<li class ='projects'><a href = 'Projects/map_tracker.zip', class = 'projects'>
			Map Tracker for Arduino (C++) </a></li>
			<p>The  program  will  load  an  Edmonton  map  and  show  a  cursor  for  the  currentlocation on the map.  Using a joystick, you will be able to move the cursor around the map andpress down the joystick to select the current location.  Then, the restaurants in the order closestto that location will be displayed on the LCD. Then you will be able to select a restaurant on thescreen using the joystick.  Pushing the joystick again will return you to the map with the selectedrestaurant at the centre of the map section. </p>
			<li class ='projects'> <a href = 'Projects/map_router.zip', class = 'projects'>
			Route Finding GPS for Arduino (C++)</a></li>
			<p>The drivingroute finder is a client/server application where Arduino is the client and the C++ application running ona desktop computer is the server. The user will be able to scroll around with a joystick on a zoomable mapof Edmonton displayed by the Arduino and select start and end points for their route. The Arduino clientwill communicate these points to the C++ server, which has all of the street information for Edmonton.The server application will find the shortest path (by distance along the path) and return the waypointsof this path to the Arduino client. The Arduino will then display the path as lines overlaid on the originalmap. The user can then repeatedly query new points via the Arduino to receive new routes.</p>
			<li class ='projects'> <a href = 'Projects/sudoku.zip', class = 'projects'>
			Sudoku Puzzle Game Arduino (C++) </a></li>
			<p>In this project, we are creating an interactive Sudoku game on the Arduino using the MEGA 2560 touchscreen as the I/O device. A random Sudoku puzzle is generated or read from a text file based on the userâ€™s choice of difficulty (4x4 & 9x9). The user can then solve the puzzle by entering numbers in the cells. We will treat the Sudoku puzzle as a graph, therefore, functionalities such as solving, suggesting the next possible move(s), undoing, reporting failures will be done using a graph search/coloring algorithm.</p>
